## Future Improvements
The assignment could be improved in a few ways. First, clearer guidelines about testing requirements would be helpful. While Fig 2 provides test cases, it's unclear whether additional unit tests are expected. In my opinion I probably went overboard with the unit testing for verifying the instruction parameters. Also, adding optional bonus requirements (maybe support for multiple transactions at the same time) for bonus points would be great.
